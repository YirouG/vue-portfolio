          <p>
            Greetings! I'm Roxy, a self-taught photographer on a mission to
            capture colours of the world through my lens. What started as a
            hobby soon turned into a profound passion for me. I love exploring
            new places and cultures, and photography allows me to document these
            experiences in a way that words simply cannot. From the vivid colors
            of a seaside sunset to the tranquil stillness of a misty morning, I
            aim to capture the essence of the world around me. Through my
            photographs, I hope to transport viewers to distant lands and let
            them experience the emotions and stories hidden within each frame.
